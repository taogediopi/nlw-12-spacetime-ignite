# Renoise 3.1: A Powerful Music Tracker for Windows, Mac and Linux
 
Renoise is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that lets you compose, edit and record production-quality audio using a music tracker-based approach. It features a wide range of built-in audio processors, alongside support for all commonly used virtual instrument and effect plug-in formats[^1^] [^2^].

In this article, we will review some of the new features and improvements that were introduced in Renoise 3.1, the latest version of this innovative software.
 
## Improved Sound Engine
 
Renoise 3.1 contains numerous improvements to the sound engine, such as:
 
- All new digital and analog styled zero delay filters with saturation and optional oversampling - everywhere[^3^]. The new filters are offered as two new standalone DSP devices - âDigital Filterâ and âAnalog Filterâ, as polyphonic modulation filters, and are used internally in many existing and updated DSP devices (e.g. the Chorus device). New filters types include a 3 pole K35 filter, Biquad, classic Moog and Diode 4 or 2 pole filters, a Vowel filter, a Chebyshev 4 and 8n filter with customizable ripple and Butterworth 4 and 8n filters.
- New, optional bandlimited/oversampled sample playback to reduce aliasing, which is especially useful when using small looped samples[^3^]. If you prefer to draw your waveforms by hand, or are a heavy user of single-cycle sounds, this feature can make quite a difference.
- New Note frequency tuned Comb DSP device, oversampling option for the Distortion device, new bandlimited oscillators in the RingMod and AM modulation filters in instruments[^3^].
- New Chorus, Flanger and Phaser with resettable phase and new filters[^3^].
- Improved, now zero-latency Convolver device, which will sound more âdenseâ with small IRs (e.g. cabinet IRs) and should create less CPU peaks, XRUNS with very large IRs (e.g. Reverbs)[^3^].
- New âApply Post Track Volumeâ option for the Send and MultiSend devices - this makes it possible to use the post-gain level to control any send device, anywhere in the DSP chain[^3^].
- Support for sample rates up to 192000 Hz (if the sound card/driver supports it - always available when offline rendering)[^3^].

## Refinements to Phrases
 
Phrases in Renoise 3.1 have become a lot more powerful and streamlined too - when working within the phrase editor, you could describe it as âfeeling more like the pattern editorâ. And when working in the pattern editor, you have more options for controlling phrases:

- Phrases can now be triggered in two different ways. First mode is called KEYMAP, and will allow you to assign a phrase to a particular range on the keyboard. This is basically how Renoise 3.0 works. The second mode is called PROGRAM and will allow you to select any phrase and play it over the entire range of the keyboard, without the need to create a key-mapping first[^3^].
- Phrases can now be transposed by notes or octaves using keyboard shortcuts[^3^].
- Phrases can now be played back at different speeds (LPB) than the song itself[^3^]. This opens up a lot of creative possibilities for rhythmic variations and polyrhythms.
- Phrases can now be looped or played once per note trigger[^3^]. This makes it easier to create sustained sounds or arpeggios with phrases.
- Phrases can now be edited with mouse selection tools (copy/paste/cut/delete) as well as keyboard shortcuts[^3^]. You can also drag and drop notes between phrases or from phrases to patterns.
- Phrases can now be recorded live from MIDI input or computer keyboard[^3^]. You can also quantize your recordings to match the phrase grid.
- Phrases can now be synced to song position or start from scratch on each note trigger[^3^]. This allows you to create complex 0f148eb4a0
